//because we want to avoid the repetitives task, and apply Don't repeat yourself.
// Example of a for loop:
for (var counter = 1; counter < 6; counter + 1) {
  console.log(counter);
}
//in general we have;
for (var start; condition; increment / decrement) {
  statements; //this will only be executed when condition is true.
